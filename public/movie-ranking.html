<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Goodfellas</h3>
<p>Martin Scorsese is a master of his craft.  
    The genre, cast, story, and cinematography are
    without fault.  
</p>

<h3>From Russia with love</h3>
<p>This is a classic James Bond movie.  It is 
    My favorite from the series.  Sean Conery delivers
    a wonderful performance, and his supporting cast
    does a fantastic job
</p>

<h3>The Avengers: Infinity War</h3>
<p>for once, the good guys loose.</p>
